== Description ==
Inline Stock Quotes is a WordPress plugin that allows users to use the [stock] shortcode to insert dynamically updating quotes into their posts.

By default, quoted prices appear green when daily change is positive, white when neutral, and red when negative. The look is similar to what you'll find on business news sites like CNBC and Motley Fool!

For detailed instructions on using this plugin, including shortcode examples and images,  visit http://elliottbernstein.com/inline-stock-quotes/ or continue to read below.

While creating or editing a post, simply type:

`[stock symbol="YOUR-SYMBOL-HERE"]`

For example, to get a quote for Apple, type:

`[stock symbol="AAPL"]`

All elements of the quote can take custom color values, including background, symbol & current price, and positive change, negative change, and no change values. Use any CSS-recognized color format, including hex values, color names, and RGBA. Remember to include the "#" symbol before any Hex values or they won't work!

The font face, font size, and font weight can be customized via the settings page. Simply enter any regonized font family or series of font families to customize font. For for size, use any units including px, em, rem, %, or vh.
